<h3>Rometica is a math puzzle game.</h3>
<p>
The concept for Rometica derived from a discussion on database design and evolved from a 28 line code snippet  into a rewarding, and replayable web application. The rules are simple: three numbers on each tile represent an arithmetic equation, and the player selects the two numbers that add together to equal the third.

<h3>Rometica is a math learning game.</h3>
<p>
I wanted to make a game that would be both fun and educational. The multiplication version, for instance, is a great way for kids to learn their times tables.
