== Rometica - The Math Puzzle Game, by Greg Barozzi Twitter: @glbarozzi


=== Why another math game?
Rometica is a whole learning project. The playability of the game allows my son to develop and hone his math skills. I wanted the game to be fun and replayable, and I feel that I have achieved that. In addition (eww, puns), I wanted to try my hand at developing a Ruby app using the Rails MVC framework. 
I feel that the game is a success on both fronts. Even though this is a small application, I was able to work my way into a comfort zone with the standard components of a Rails app and get a good feel for the conventions used in the layout, development, and deployment of a complete web app in Rails.

=== How to Play: Arithmetic (Green Rometica)
Select the two numbered tiles that, when added together, equal a third numbered tile. 

=== How to Play: Multiplication (Red Rometica)
Select the two numbered tiles that, when multiplied together, equal a third numbered tile.

=== Under the Hood:
Rometica uses database tables populated with arrays of randomly generated numbers that meet the constraints which allow each tile to have only one solution. When a game is loaded in the browser, a tile is selected at random and the order shuffled in order to enhance replayability. By pre-populating a table with acceptable numbered tuples, I was able to achieve a (very) significant performance over generating random lists of acceptable numbers on each page-load. Because of this, the most complicated code in this application resides in the seeds.rb file used to populate the DB.

=== Game Logic at runtime:
Itâ€™s just basic arithmetic. The key to each tile is stored in the DOM and the numbered tiles the player chooses are added together and compared against the key by JQuery.
